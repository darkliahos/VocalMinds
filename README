This application was orignally created for my final year project in 2010 however since then I have not really touched it since graduating and as a result
there may be lots of unfinished code, some unstable codes. 

The purpose of Vocal Minds was to help childern or adults with special needs to difficulties with communications understand the how communication can work.
How to understand facial expressions and tones of voices. 

Current features are:

Voice Recognition - This is quite buggy and uses Windows SAPI library
Facial expression quiz
Tone Of voice Quiz
Social simulator - This needs a lot of work to get it up to standards

I have included a lot of my rendered images from the project, I have lost all the social simulator videos, If I find them I will include them

I am releasing my code out there for anyone interested out there. Please feel free to make changes and reupload them to this repository here.
