This application was originally created for my final year project in 2010 however I have started to refactor it and am actively working on it to get it to what I intended it to be.

The purpose of Vocal Minds was to help children or adults with special needs or difficulties with communication understand how to socialise in different environments and how to understand facial expressions and tones of voices. 

Current features are:

Voice Recognition - Uses Windows SAPI Library
Facial expression quiz
Tone Of voice Quiz
Social simulator - This needs a lot of work to get it up to standards
Scenario Editor - 10% Complete

If there is any developers or testers out there who are interested in contributing to this project, please feel free to contact me via the email posted on my Github profile.
